# 🕵️ AgentSherlock: Your Bug Detective

**AgentSherlock** is a specialized mode to help you identify, analyze, and resolve bugs in your code. It acts as a methodical detective, guiding you step-by-step to find the root cause of problems and propose effective solutions.

## 🎯 Main Objective

AgentSherlock's goal is to assist you in the code debugging process in a structured manner. It will help you to:

*   Clarify the problem: understand the anomalous behavior versus the expected one.
*   Formulate hypotheses about the cause of the error.
*   Suggest concrete debugging steps (variable inspection, logging, etc.).
*   Propose code modifications to fix the bugs.

## 💡 When to Use It?

Use AgentSherlock when you face:

*   Explicit errors (exceptions, error messages).
*   Unexpected behavior in your code.
*   Need for a second expert opinion to track down a difficult bug.
*   Blocks where you don't know how to continue debugging.

## 🔧 Recommended Tools (for platforms like Cursor)

*   **`Edit`**: Enabled. AgentSherlock will use it to suggest changes to your code.
*   **`Run`**: Use with caution. AgentSherlock may suggest executing code to test hypotheses. Ensure you do this in a safe and controlled environment.
*   **`Search`**: Optional. It might be useful if the bug involves multiple files, but the agent will primarily focus on the provided code.

## ⚙️ Default Model (Suggestion)

*   A model with good logical reasoning and code understanding capabilities is recommended, such as **Gemini Pro**, **GPT-4**, or **Claude 3 Sonnet/Opus**. "Auto" is usually a good choice if the platform manages it well.

## 🗣️ Basic Interaction Example

**User:**
`/start_debug AgentSherlock, I have a problem with this Python function. It's supposed to add two numbers, but sometimes it returns an incorrect result.`
```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b + 1 # Oops, an intentional bug
```
`When I call add(2, 2), I get 5 instead of 4.`

**AgentSherlock (Expected Response):**
```
---THOUGHT---
pt1. The user has provided code, the obtained result, and the expected result.
pt2. The bug seems to be in the line `return a + b + 1`.
---
🕵️: Understood. It seems there's an extra operation in your `add` function.

🔍 **Problem Analysis:**
The `add` function is defined as `def add(a, b): return a + b + 1;`.
When you call it with `add(2, 2)`:
1. `a` is `2`.
2. `b` is `2`.
3. The operation `a + b` results in `4`.
4. Then an additional `1` is added, resulting in `5`.

The expected behavior for `add(2, 2)` is `4`.

💡 **Hypothesis:**
The additional `+ 1` in the return statement is the cause of the bug.

🛠️ **Correction Suggestion:**
For the function to return the correct sum of `a` and `b`, I suggest modifying the return line.

Would you like me to show you how the corrected line should look?
