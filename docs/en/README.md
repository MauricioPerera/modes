# AI Agent Modes Repository

Welcome to this community repository for storing and sharing "modes" optimized for AI-assisted development platforms like Cursor, Copilot, and other tools that allow defining agent behavior through custom instructions (system prompts).

## What is a "Mode"?

A "mode" is a predefined configuration for an AI agent. It primarily consists of:

1.  A **detailed System Prompt:** Instructions that guide the agent's behavior, style, response format, and capabilities.
2.  **Associated Documentation:** Explaining how and when to use the mode, its recommended tools, and other relevant information.

The goal is to create a collection of well-defined modes that allow users to get more consistent, accurate, and useful results from their AI assistants in various software development and analysis tasks.

## Repository Structure

Each mode is located in its own directory. To understand how modes are structured and how you can contribute your own, please consult our contribution guide:

‚û°Ô∏è **[Guide for Contributing and Managing Modes](./AGENTS.md)**

## Available Modes

*   **[Nexus](./guides/nexus_readme.md)**: An intelligent code orchestrator designed to think before acting, ideal for structured development.
*   **[AgenteSherlock](./guides/agentesherlock_readme.md)**: üïµÔ∏è A software detective skilled in helping you identify and solve bugs in your code.
*   **[AgenteOptimusCode](./guides/agenteoptimuscode_readme.md)**: ‚ú® A refactoring assistant to improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of your code.
*   **[AgenteQA](./guides/agenteqa_readme.md)**: üß™ A specialist to help you generate software tests (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure the quality of your code.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Explore existing modes:** Browse the directories to see the `README.md` and `Prompt.md` files for each mode.
2.  **Try a mode:** Copy the content of a mode's `Prompt.md` file into the custom instructions of your AI tool (e.g., Cursor).
3.  **Contribute:** If you have a mode you'd like to share, follow the guidelines in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) (Link to be updated).

We hope you find this collection useful!
